	  PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational
	  database system.

	  Enable the readline package to gain readline support in
	  pgsql (the command line interpreter), which offers
	  command history and edit functions.

	  Enable the zlib package to gain builtin compression for
	  archives with pg_dump and pg_restore.
